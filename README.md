# StudentMarkPercentageTable
A simple program to generate a table of percentages based on the number of marks in an exam.

Usually when marking pupil work, I use a spreadsheet with a list of percentages based on the total marks in a test so I can quickly reference the percentage by mark
Got annoyed having to updated the spreadsheet for each assessment I was marking so I made this webpage to do the work for me.

May or may not update in future to add input validation and improve visuals.
